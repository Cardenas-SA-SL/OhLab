/**
 * THE PER-NODE CAPABILITY, READ — one POSIX-sh resolver, every generated client.
 *
 * Four generated clients present this node's token: the managed hook script, the canvas-control
 * shim (`ohlab.sh`), the context-link shim (`context.sh`) and the codex launcher. Three of them
 * carried the SAME two lines by copy — read `$NODETERM_NODE_TOKEN_DIR/$NODETERM_NODE_ID`, or
 * nothing — and that copy is what issue #384 was:
 *
 *   the dir is advertised ONLY by the endpoint file, and a session is pinned for life to the
 *   endpoint PATH it was handed at tmux creation (`buildPtyEnv` / `remoteHookEnvArgs`).
 *
 * So a session whose endpoint file does not advertise a dir presents no token at all, forever,
 * while its token file sits in the standard place. Three populations land there, all measured:
 *
 *  - **A pre-v2 endpoint file that is still LIVE.** SSH hosts used to share one
 *    `~/.nodeterm/hook-endpoint.env`; the current build writes per-project
 *    `hook-endpoint-<projectId>.env` and never rewrites the old path again. The old file names
 *    `~/.nodeterm/hook-<projectId>.sock` — a path that is RE-BOUND on every connect of that
 *    project — so it keeps reaching a live server while advertising no token dir. Reproduced on a
 *    real host: a `VERSION=1` file dated a month earlier, pointing at a socket created minutes ago.
 *  - **A session whose env carries the transport directly and no readable endpoint file** — what
 *    the phone hands a session it spawns (see the managed script's own gate comment).
 *  - **A partial read of an endpoint file** being rewritten under the reader.
 *
 * The failure this produces is not "unverified": it is a hard 403 with
 * `IDENTITY_REFUSED_NOTE`, because the node is LATCHED. The managed hook script has an endpoint
 * FAILOVER that adopts a live sibling endpoint and re-reads the token from ITS dir, so the same
 * node proves itself through the hook and is refused through the shim — trust-on-first-proof then
 * refuses every canvas-control call for the life of the session. The shims never learned the
 * failover, so the asymmetry was permanent and invisible.
 *
 * THE FIX, and why it can only ever help: the read falls back from the advertised dir to
 * `<dir of the endpoint file>/node-tokens` — which is the layout BY CONSTRUCTION on all three
 * surfaces (`<userData>/hook-endpoint.env` + `<userData>/node-tokens` on desktop and Server
 * Edition, `<home>/.nodeterm/hook-endpoint-<p>.env` + `<home>/.nodeterm/node-tokens` on an SSH
 * host) — and then to the same well-known data dirs the managed script already walks for endpoint
 * files.
 *
 * It is monotone, and that is the whole safety argument:
 *
 *  - the ADVERTISED dir is always tried first, so nothing that verifies today stops verifying;
 *  - the lookup is by `$NODETERM_NODE_ID` FILENAME in every candidate, so a session can still only
 *    ever present its own node's token — the property `never presents ANOTHER node's token file`
 *    is a property of the key, not of the directory;
 *  - a dir belonging to a DIFFERENT instance mints under a different secret, so its token carries a
 *    foreign `kid`, which `verifyNodeToken` reads as `legacy` — bit-for-bit what presenting nothing
 *    already gave. It can never read as `forged` (that needs OUR kid over another node's mac, and
 *    the filename forbids it) and it can never read as a different node.
 *
 * So each candidate can turn `legacy` into `verified` and nothing else. The happy path costs
 * exactly one `head`, as before: only a miss walks.
 *
 * NOT USED BY the codex launcher (`core/codex-identity-proxy.ts`), deliberately. That client
 * REFUSES outright when the endpoint file is unreadable (`nt_fail hook-endpoint-unavailable`) and
 * degrades to plain codex with a named reason, which is a different and already-honest contract;
 * folding it in here would change what it reports, not just what it reads. Its read is one line
 * beside a `case` gate on the wire shape — if it ever grows a fallback, it grows THIS one.
 */

/**
 * Defines `nt_read_node_token [endpoint-file]`, which sets `nt_node_token` to this node's
 * capability or to '' when there is none to present. Never fails: '' is an ordinary state (a
 * pre-token session, a remote write that did not land) that the server reads as `legacy`, and a
 * hook client must not be able to die over identity.
 *
 * The optional argument is for the managed script's failover, which must anchor the derivation to
 * the endpoint it JUST ADOPTED rather than to the primary it is walking away from. Omitted, it
 * anchors to `$NODETERM_HOOK_ENDPOINT`.
