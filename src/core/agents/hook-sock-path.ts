/**
 * Where the hook server's unix-domain listener binds (issue #367).
 *
 * The SUN_LEN limit is REAL and this repo has hit it twice: `sun_path` is 104 bytes on macOS
 * (108 on Linux) INCLUDING the trailing NUL, and both the SSH ControlMaster
 * (`core/remote-ssh/control-master.ts`) and the codex relay daemon learned that a socket under a
 * long data dir simply fails to bind/connect. So the same discipline applies here:
 *
 *  - primary: `<userDataDir>/sock/hook.sock` — a deliberately SHORT filename inside a private
 *    0700 subdirectory (the directory's mode is what actually protects the socket from other
 *    local users; the 0600 chmod on the socket file itself is belt and braces);
 *  - fallback, when the primary would not fit sun_path (a deep macOS "Application Support" path,
 *    a long username): `~/.nodeterm/sock/hook-<sha256(userDataDir)[:16]>.sock` — the exact shape
 *    `controlSocketPath` uses for the SSH masters. Home, NOT os.tmpdir(): a world-writable /tmp
 *    lets any local user pre-create ("squat") the predictable name, and the sticky bit then stops
 *    us from unlinking it — the homedir path has neither problem. The digest keys the file to the
 *    data dir so two instances (two data dirs) never fight over one socket.
