/**
 * The Codex-sandbox self-diagnosis both generated sh shims share (issue #367).
 *
 * Codex's command sandbox denies network connect() outright when its network policy is disabled —
 * on Linux a seccomp filter EPERMs `connect()` for EVERY address family (unix sockets included,
 * with no allowlist), and on macOS the seatbelt base profile is `(deny default)` with no
 * network-outbound allowance. Either way curl dies with exit != 0 / HTTP 000 while the nodeterm
 * hook server is perfectly healthy, and the shims' generic "nodeterm unreachable" message sent
 * agents (and users) off to relink or restart a server that was never the problem.
 *
 * Codex exports `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED=1` into every sandboxed command on both
 * platforms, so the shims can tell the two failures apart at the exact moment they happen. The
 * remedies differ by platform:
 *  - both: retry the SAME command once with command-specific escalated permissions (the sandbox
 *    is per-command; an escalated retry runs outside it);
 *  - macOS only (codex >= 0.146): `network.allow_unix_sockets = ["<hook sock>"]` in
 *    ~/.codex/config.toml permanently re-opens exactly the hook socket inside the sandbox, no
 *    escalation needed. Linux has no such allowlist, so that line would be a false promise there
 *    — the fragment gates it on `uname -s` = Darwin as well as on the socket being advertised.
 *
 * The message text lives in exported constants so the agent-facing docs (skill bodies + AGENTS.md
 * instruction blocks) can carry the same sentences and the parity tests can hold the two ends
 * together; the sh fragment is exercised against real /bin/sh in the shim test suites.
