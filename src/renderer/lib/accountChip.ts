 * Per-node Claude account labelling — the pure half of the account chip.
 *
 * A node's account has TWO possible sources and they routinely disagree:
 *  - `data.accountId` — the managed/linked account the node was CREATED with. Immutable, and the
 *    only thing that steers `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` at spawn.
 *  - `ObservedClaudeAccount` — what the RUNNING session's hooks reported (agent-status store).
 *    For a plain terminal where the user ran `export CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-2; claude`, this
 *    is the only identity that exists anywhere.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and display/read-only. An observed account is a LABEL (see the
 * `ObservedClaudeAccount` doc comment in shared/types): it may decide what we SHOW and whose
 * transcripts we READ, never what is permitted — so nothing in this module is a gate.
 *
 * PASS THE LIVE `accounts` LIST AT EVERY CALL SITE. It is optional only so the parameter could be
 * added without touching every caller, and the default `[]` is not "don't resolve" — it means "no
 * accounts exist", which is a real state (the user just unlinked their only one) and makes
 * `resolveObserved` degrade every observed id to its bare dir. Omitting it therefore reads as
 * "every account was removed", which is exactly wrong in the one case it matters.

 * Re-resolve an observation against the CURRENT account list.
 *
 * The hook server classifies `transcript_path` at POST time, so an observation is frozen as of the
 * account list that existed then — and nothing else would ever revisit it: a quiet pane may not
 * post another hook for hours. Linking and unlinking are settings edits, so the renderer is the
 * only place that can notice, and this is where it does. Everything else in this module goes
 * through it, so the chip, the keys, the detected list and the readers cannot disagree about the
 * same dir.
 *
 * Two directions, and both are about the DIR, which is the one fact that outlives the record:
 *  - unknown dir + an account now claiming it  ⇒ that account (the link case);
 *  - a known id that no longer exists          ⇒ back to the bare dir, `known: false` (the unlink
 *    or remove case). Without this the pane showed "Unknown account" and its dir vanished from
 *    Settings → Detected, so there was no way back to Link short of waiting for the next turn.
 *    A re-link under a NEW id is picked up by the same dir match, hence one code path.
 *
 * The system account (`known` with `accountId: null`) is never touched: it has no record to lose.
 * `data.accountId` is likewise untouched — a NODE created under a removed account still reads
 * "Unknown account", which is correct: that binding really is dangling.
 *
 * **A REMOTE observation is never dir-matched against a local account** (`observed.remote`), in
 * either direction. `ClaudeAccount.configDir` is set only by `claudeAccounts.link`, which is a
 * LOCAL adoption — the path it stores names a directory on this machine — while a remote pane's
 * dir names one on its host, and `~/.claude-2` on a server and `~/.claude-2` here spell the same
 * string whenever the two machines share a username, which is the ordinary case rather than a
 * corner. Matching them would label the remote pane with a local account's identity, and
 * `effectiveAccountId` would then hand that id to the LOCAL transcript, session-name and usage
 * readers. Managed-remote observations are unaffected: they arrive `known: true` carrying a real
 * `accountId` (classifier rule 2, `~/.nodeterm/claude-accounts/<id>`), and the id-based branch
 * above resolves them against the account list without ever looking at a path.

 * which is this module's standing failure direction: one chip fewer, never a wrong one. The
 * alternative, a second key dialect for remote dirs, would mean the chip has to parse two shapes
 * to recover a path, and one resolution feeding chip + keys + detected list is the invariant that
