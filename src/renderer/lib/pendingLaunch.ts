// dependency edges to draw meanwhile. Kept free of React/store imports so the satisfaction
// matrix is unit-testable — Canvas.tsx only wraps these in an effect and a setState.

 * when a downstream station should start reading it. It does NOT mean "this station will never
 * run again": an agent that finishes turn 1 and awaits more input is also `done`. That is the
 * intended semantics for a station given one self-contained prompt, and it is documented as
 * such rather than being papered over with a turn counter that would guess differently.
 *
 * A dep that is no longer on the canvas counts as satisfied — a deleted node can never report,
 * so treating it as pending would strand the dependent forever. An UNKNOWN state (the dep
 * exists but has reported nothing yet) is deliberately NOT satisfied: right after a fan-out the
 * upstream stations have not emitted a hook event yet, and reading "no news" as "finished"
 * would fire every dependent immediately — the exact bug that makes a dependency edge useless.

 * Which armed nodes are ready to launch, given the live canvas and the current agent states.
 * `live` is passed in (rather than derived from `nodes`) because the caller already holds the
 * full node list while `nodes` here may be pre-filtered.
 *
 * `setupDone` is the SECOND gate, for a node opened into a worktree frame whose project runs a
 * setup script with `waitForSetup`: the node's command must not race an `npm ci` that is still
 * writing node_modules underneath it. It answers per group id, and the two gates are ANDed —
 * a node can be waiting on both its upstream stations and its checkout being ready.
 *
 * An ABSENT probe (`setupDone` not passed) means the gate is open. That is the honest default,
 * not laxness: the run store is rebuilt from live events, so after an app restart a node armed
 * with `awaitSetupGroup` has no run to hear from ever again, and reading "nothing known" as
 * "still running" would strand it forever — the same reasoning as a deleted dependency counting
 * as satisfied. (The caller's probe applies the same rule to a group with no entry.)
