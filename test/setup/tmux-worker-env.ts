// TEST-ONLY — issue #629. The worker half of the tmux sandbox; see `tmux-sandbox.ts` for why.
//
// `globalSetup` runs in vitest's main process and the workers inherit its environment, so this file
// is usually re-stating what is already true. It exists because that inheritance is vitest's
// implementation detail, not its contract: a pool that snapshotted the environment before
// `globalSetup` ran would silently hand every worker the DEFAULT tmux directory — i.e. the
// machine's live `ohlab` server — and nothing in a green suite would say so.
//
// It refuses rather than inventing a directory of its own. A per-worker fallback would be a sandbox
// nobody ever removes, and "the isolation is not wired" is exactly the thing that must be loud.
