// TEST-ONLY — issue #629: the whole vitest run gets a private `TMUX_TMPDIR`, so no test can reach
// the tmux servers this machine is actually running nodeterm on.
//
// tmux resolves `-L <socket>` to `$TMUX_TMPDIR/tmux-<uid>/<socket>`, falling back to `/tmp` when
// the variable is unset. A test that names `ohlab` or `ohlab-rmt` therefore lands on the
// SHARED server carrying every live node on the machine — the developer's own canvas when the suite
// is run from inside a nodeterm terminal, which is how this repo is normally developed.
// `src/main/remote/host-destroy-tmux.test.ts` did exactly that by design (measured: it binds
// `ohlab`, creates sessions on it and drives a real `PtyManager` against it), and
// `src/core/agents/pane-owner.test.ts` runs a real `tmux -L ohlab-rmt` because the bytes it
// judges hardcode that name.
//
// Neither was proven to be the killer in #629 — the reporter's evidence points at the tmux server
// hitting a `fatal()` under the suite's process/fd burst, not at a `kill-server` from a test. But
// "the suite shares a server with the user's live sessions" is a hazard whatever kills it, and it
// is one this file removes by construction rather than by everybody remembering the rule.
//
// The sandbox is per RUN, not per file: `setup` creates it in the main process (so the workers
// inherit the variable), `teardown` kills whatever is still bound inside it and removes it. Suites
// that make their OWN private `TMUX_TMPDIR` are unaffected — this is the floor, not an override.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: two suites naming the same socket inside the sandbox still share one tmux
// server, so a `kill-server` there is still a shared-server kill — it has just been moved somewhere
// harmless. Measured on CI the day this landed: the guard test's `kill-server` on `ohlab`
// ended `host-destroy-tmux.test.ts`'s session mid-assertion. A suite kills its OWN sessions by
// exact target (`-t =<name>`), or it owns a socket name nothing else uses.
